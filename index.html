  <h1>I'm Yara - a student at <a href="https://www.arrayschool.com/index.html" target="_blank"> The Array School of Code and Design</a>.</h1>

    <p> I am an aspiring designer in Cheyenne, Wyoming working on becoming part of <br> this fun and challenging tech industry. My main interest is design with a secondary focus on back end solutions. <br> I am an adept multitasker, able to work independently or as a member of a professional design team!</p><br>

    <p>Volunteer work include weekend adoption event ads for a non-profit dog rescue and job-related publications and events.</p>
